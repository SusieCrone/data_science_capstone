# Starbucks Capstone Project — Predicting Customer Behavior

This repository is for my Udacity Starbucks Capstone Project. In the project I have explored customer behavior using transactional, demographic, and offer data provided by Starbucks, by applying data cleaning and unsupervised machine learning techniques to uncover customer segments and predict response rates to offers.

## Project Overview

Starbucks provided simulated data on customer demographics, transaction histories, and interactions with various offers. My goal was to predict whether a customer would respond to an offer or not.

### Key Objectives:
- Clean and prepare the three datasets.
- Engineer features to help identify offer effectiveness.
- Predict whether a customer is likely to see and respond to an offer or not.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Unsupervised Machine Learning
